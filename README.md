## This repository
This repository is used for analysing and plotting data from the Linux kernel I am working on  
for the master thesis "Improving TCP Slow Start pacing in Linux"

This repository consists of two main directories:  
- ***mininet*** which is used for simulations in mininet, essentially generating data to analyse
- ***analysis*** which is where all the plots and packet analysis is done
